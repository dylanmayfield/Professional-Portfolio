# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

I designed this personal portfolio to meet all the requirements of challenge 2.

I ensured that all the nav links function correctly. When clicked the UI scrolls to the appropriate topic.

In the portfolio there is a sample of previous work history, an about me, and my past projects.

I ensured that the image of the first application is larger in size than the others.

When the project link is clicked you are directed to the deployed application.

I ensured this application works with multiple screen types when the page is resized.
